# Bitcoin Scripting Assignment

This repository contains the code and instructions for the Bitcoin Scripting Assignment, which involves creating and validating Bitcoin transactions using **Legacy (P2PKH)** and **SegWit (P2SH-P2WPKH)** address formats. The project is implemented in **Python** and interacts with **Bitcoin Core** (`bitcoind`) using RPC calls.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- **Bitcoin Core** â€“ Download from [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/).  
- **Python 3** â€“ Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.  
- **Python Libraries** â€“ Install the required Python libraries using pip:  

```bash
pip install python-bitcoinrpc
```

---

## Setting Up Bitcoin Core

### 1. Download Bitcoin Core  
- Download the latest version of Bitcoin Core from [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/).  
- Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.  

### 2. Install Bitcoin Core  
- After installation, ensure `bitcoind` (Bitcoin Daemon) and `bitcoin-cli` (Bitcoin Command Line Interface) are available in your system's PATH.  

---

## Configuring `bitcoin.conf`

To run Bitcoin Core in regtest mode, configure the `bitcoin.conf` file:

### 1. Locate the Bitcoin Data Directory  
- **Linux**: `~/.bitcoin/`  
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/`  
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\`  

### 2. Create or Edit `bitcoin.conf`  
Create a file named `bitcoin.conf` if it doesnâ€™t exist, and add the following configuration:

```ini
[regtest]
rpcuser=decentrix_crew
rpcpassword=decentrix
rpcport=18443
server=1
txindex=1
paytxfee=0.0001
fallbackfee=0.0002
mintxfee=0.00001
txconfirmtarget=6
```

**Explanation**:  
- `[regtest]` â€“ Enables regtest mode (local blockchain for testing).  
- `server=1` â€“ Allows RPC connections.  
- `rpcuser`, `rpcpassword` â€“ Credentials for RPC authentication.  
- `rpcport=18443` â€“ Port for RPC connections in regtest mode.  
- `rpcallowip=127.0.0.1` â€“ Allows RPC connections from localhost.  
- `txindex=1` â€“ Enables transaction indexing (required for some RPC calls).

## Running Bitcoin Core in Regtest Mode (On Windows)
 
### Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and `cd` into the installed directory. 

```bash
cd "C:/Program Files/Bitcoin/daemon"
``` 

### Start the daemon by entering , 

```bash
.\bitcoind -regtest
```

Now your bitcoin node is running in regtest mode.

## Running the Scripts

This repository contains four Python scripts:

1. **A_to_B_legacy_transaction.py** â€“ Creates a transaction from a Legacy (P2PKH) address A to address B.  
2. **B_to_C_legacy_transaction.py** â€“ Creates a transaction from Legacy address B to address C.  
3. **A_to_B_segwit_transaction.py** â€“ Creates a transaction from a SegWit (P2SH-P2WPKH) address A' to address B'.  
4. **B_to_C_segwit_transaction.py** â€“ Creates a transaction from SegWit address B' to address C'.  

### Steps to Run the Scripts

1. **Clone the Repository**  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anmoljain2005/DeCentrix_btc_tx_analyser.git
cd DeCentrix_btc_tx_analyser
```

2. **Run Legacy Transactions**  

- Transaction from Legacy address A to B:  
```bash
python A_to_B_legacy_transaction.py
```

- Transaction from Legacy address B to C:  
```bash
python B_to_C_legacy_transaction.py
```

3. **Run SegWit Transactions**  

- **Restart regtest mode** before running SegWit transactions:  

```bash
cd "C:/Program Files/Bitcoin/daemon"
.\bitcoind -regtest
```

- Transaction from SegWit address A' to B':  
```bash
python A_to_B_segwit_transaction.py
```

- Transaction from SegWit address B' to C':  
```bash
python B_to_C_segwit_transaction.py
```

## Script Descriptions

### 1. **A_to_B_legacy_transaction.py**  
- Connects to `bitcoind` using RPC.  
- Creates a new wallet or loads an existing one.  
- Generates three Legacy addresses (A, B, and C).  
- Funds address A and creates a transaction from A to B.  
- Decodes and analyzes the transaction.  

### 2. **B_to_C_legacy_transaction.py**  
- Loads transaction details from the previous script.  
- Creates a transaction from Legacy address B to C.  
- Decodes and analyzes the transaction, including the challenge and response scripts.  

### 3. **A_to_B_segwit_transaction.py**  
- Connects to `bitcoind` using RPC.  
- Creates a new wallet or loads an existing one.  
- Generates three SegWit addresses (A', B', and C').  
- Funds address A' and creates a transaction from A' to B'.  
- Decodes and analyzes the transaction.  

### 4. **B_to_C_segwit_transaction.py**  
- Loads transaction details from the previous script.  
- Creates a transaction from SegWit address B' to C'.  
- Decodes and analyzes the transaction, including the witness data.

## Validating Scripts Using Bitcoin Debugger (`btcdeb`)

To validate the correctness of the **challenge and response scripts**, you can use the **Bitcoin Debugger (`btcdeb`)**. The debugger allows you to step through the execution of Bitcoin scripts and verify their behavior.

### Steps to Use `btcdeb`

1. **Access the Debugger**  
   - For Linux users, log in to the server using the following credentials:  
     ```bash
     ssh -x guest@10.206.4.201
     ```
     Password: `root1234`  

2. **Run `btcdeb`**  
   - Once logged in, use the `btcdeb` command to debug your scripts.  
   ```bash
     btcdeb --tx=<transaction_hex> --txin=<input_hex>
   ```

Here:
- `<transaction_hex>` is the full hexadecimal representation of your transaction.
- `<input_hex>` is the hex of the previous transaction output being spent.

3. **Step Through the Script**
Use `btcdeb` commands to analyze each step of script execution:

- **Step through instructions:**
  ```bash
  btcdeb> step
  ```
- **View the stack:**
  ```bash
  btcdeb> stack
  ```
- **Print the full script:**
  ```bash
  btcdeb> print
  ```

The debugger will show how data is pushed onto the stack and how operations like `OP_DUP`, `OP_HASH160`, `OP_EQUALVERIFY`, and `OP_CHECKSIG` are executed.


4. **Analyze the Output**  
   - The debugger will simulate the execution of the script step by step.  
   - If the script is valid, the final stack will contain `1` (true).  
   - If the script is invalid, the debugger will highlight the error.

## Report and Analysis

The report includes:  
- A comparison of transaction sizes between Legacy (P2PKH) and SegWit (P2SH-P2WPKH) transactions.  
- Analysis of the script structures and how they validate transactions.  
- Screenshots of decoded scripts and Bitcoin debugger execution.
